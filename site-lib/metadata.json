Operations","icon":"","description":"\nBitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate individual bits (0s and 1s) of binary numbers using logical operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts. If you write in C++, there's a great chance you will need to use it sooner or later.\nMost popular languages support bitwise operations\nBitwise operators are best aligned with when you use C/C++ since the languages are usually used when you need to do fine-grained bit manipulation Base Meaning: The number of unique digits a system uses (EX: Base 10 uses 0–9)\nDecimal Number Meaning: Normal number: base 10 EX: 1785\nBinary Number Meaning: Base 2, uses 0 and 1 EX: 11011111001\nOctal Number Meaning: Base 8, uses 0–7 EX: 3361\nHexadecimal Number Meaning: _Base 16, uses 0–9 and A–F EX: 6F9 Decimal: No Prefix; EX: 1785\nBinary: Prefix: 0b or 0B; EX: 0b10110\nOctal: Prefix: Leading 0; EX: 0361 Valid pre-C++14, or rather discouraged in newer versions\nHex: Prefix: 0x or 0X; EX: 0x6F9\nNOTE: you could just convert everything to binary and then convert to whatever base you'd like.Rule: Repeatedly divide by 2 and write down the remainders (bottom to top).\nExample13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\nResult: *1101*Rule: Divide by 8 and write remainders (bottom to top).\nExample83 ÷ 8 = 10 remainder 3 10 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 2 1 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 1\nResult: *123*Rule: Divide by 16 and use letters A–F for 10–15.\nExample254 ÷ 16 = 15 remainder 14 15 = F, 14 = E\nResult: *FE*Rule: Multiply each bit by 2 raised to its position power, then add them all together.\nExample(1 × 2⁴) + (0 × 2³) + (1 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰) = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 22₁₀\nResult: 22Rule: Group bits into sets of 3 from right to left, then convert each group to its decimal value.\nExampleGroup bits into 3s from right: 110 101 110 → 6 101 → 5\nResult: 65Rule: Group bits into sets of 4 from right to left, then convert each group to its hexadecimal value.\nExampleGroup bits into 4s from right: 1110 1110 1110 → E 1110 → E\nResult: EERule: Multiply each digit by 8 raised to its position power, then add them all together.\nExample347₈ = (3×8²) + (4×8¹) + (7×8⁰) = 231₁₀\nResult: 231Rule: Replace each octal digit with its 3-bit binary equivalent.\nExample347₈ → 3 4 7 → 011 100 111 → 011100111₂\nResult: 011100111Rule: First convert octal to binary, then group the binary digits into 4s to get hexadecimal.\nExample:347₈ → 011100111₂ → 0001 1100 1111 → 1CF₁₆\nResult: 1CFRule: Multiply each digit by 16 raised to its position power, then add them all together.\nExample2F₁₆ = (2×16¹) + (15×16⁰) = 47₁₀\nResult: 47Rule: Replace each hex digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent.\nExample2F₁₆ → 2 F → 0010 1111 → 00101111₂\nResult 00101111Rule: Convert hex to binary, then group the binary digits into 3s from right to left to get octal.\nExample2F₁₆ → 00101111₂ → 000 010 111 1 → 057₈\nResult: 057\nCompare each bit at the same position in the integer\nIf both are 1, then the result is 1. Any other case doesn't result in this (0).\nunsigned result = 7&amp;4; //Equals 4 1 1 1\n&amp; 1 0 0\n--------- 1 0 0\n7 is 111, and 4 is 100\nCompare each bit at the same position in the integer\nif either of them is 1, then the result is 1. if both are 0, the result is 0.\nunsigned result = 7|4; //Equals 7 1 1 1\n| 1 0 0\n--------- 1 1 1\n7 is 111, and 4 is 100\nCompare each bit at the same position in the integer\nif the bits are the same, it will be 0. if they are different, it is 1.\nIt's a reversable process (The reason it's used often!) A ^ B ^ B = A\nunsigned result = 7^4; //Equals 3 1 1 1\n^ 1 0 0\n--------- 0 1 1\n7 is 111, and 4 is 100\nPreformed on a single number.\nWill essentially make any 1 to a 0, and 0 to a 1. it's \"complement\"\nunsigned result = ~4; //Equals 3 Be aware of bit length, because this final value can be very different. this is only true for 3 bits. C++ doesn't choose 3 bit as default.~ 1 0 0\n--------- 0 1 1\n4 is 100\nShifts bits of an integer to the left by a specific number of positions.\nSame thing as # unsigned result = 5&lt;&lt;2; //Equals 200 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 &lt;&lt; 2\n---------------\n0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 Shifts bits of an integer to the right by a specific number of positions.\nSame thing as # unsigned result = 16&gt;&gt;2; //Equals 40 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 &gt;&gt; 2\n---------------\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 In C++ shifting by 0 bytes doesn't do anything\nDon't shift by equal or more than the available bit length, it's undefined behavior.\nYou can make constraints to help with the previous point. Endianness describes how multi-byte values are laid out in memory. The Least Significant Byte is stored at the lowest memory address.\nThis is used by Intel (x86 &amp; x64) CPUs. And by most modern computers.\nExample\nuint32_t x = 0xA1B2C3D4;\nMemory Storage (low high)D4 C3 B2 A1 The Most Significant Byte is stored at the lowest memory address.\nUsed by network protocols, and similar systems.\nMemory Storage (low high)\nA1 B2 C3 D4 There must be a predetermined format for different processes to read the bytes. Especially when sending data over network.\nNOTE: C/C++ provides conversion helpers to convert between the two. Flags are individual bits packed into an integer, where each bit represents an on/off option.\nExtremely common in system calls, file I/O, graphics APIs, embedded systems, and OS kernels.\nUsing flags avoids passing many separate boolean parameters. Compact (32 or 64 options in a single integer)\nFast &amp; cheap on hardware\nEasily to create\nnamespace OpenFlags {\nconstexpr uint32_t READ = 1 &lt;&lt; 0; // 0001\nconstexpr uint32_t WRITE = 1 &lt;&lt; 1; // 0010\nconstexpr uint32_t APPEND = 1 &lt;&lt; 2; // 0100\nconstexpr uint32_t TRUNC = 1 &lt;&lt; 3; // 1000\n} A bitset is a collection of bits where each bit is like a boolean value.\nSimilar to a boolean array, but way more memory efficient. Each bit position represents an index or ID\nStored using integers or arrays of bytes\nExample\nfriend list encoded in a uint16_t\n// bit positions: [15 ... 0]\nuint16_t recipients = (1 &lt;&lt; 0) | (1 &lt;&lt; 4) | (1 &lt;&lt; 7); Very compact\nCPU Cache-friendly\nIdeal for large datasets or tight memory constraints\n#include &lt;bitset&gt;\nstd::bitset&lt;128&gt; users;\nusers.set(5);\nusers.reset(12);\nusers.flip(7); Size fixed at compile time\nBounds-checked access (safer than manual bit math)\nVery fast Keeping many boolean values as bool is memory-inefficient.\nA bool usually uses 1 byte, even though it only needs 1 bit. 50 boolean values bool flags[50] → 50 bytes\nBitfield → 50 bits (~7 bytes) uint64_t features = 0;\nfeatures |= (1ULL &lt;&lt; 3); // enable feature 3\nfeatures |= (1ULL &lt;&lt; 10); // enable feature 10\nbool enabled = features &amp; (1ULL &lt;&lt; 10); Large datasets\nPerformance-critical code (For systems with low power microcomputers) Like when coding an STM microcontroller!\nMemory-constrained systems Compression often uses bit packing (like Huffman coding) Hash functions use XOR and shifts for mixing bits\nUsed when creating as unique a value as possible Uses bitwise logic to combine images via masks.\nBackground:\n1010101010\n1010101010\n1010101010\n1010101010\n1010101010\n1010101010 Mask:
